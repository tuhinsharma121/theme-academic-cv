<h2>Description</h2>

The present disclosure relates to sleep cycles, and more specifically to optimizing sleep quality by inducing sleep
stages.

Sleep cycles consist of two main types of sleep, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep.
NREM sleep is composed of three distinct stages: N1, N2, and N3. The sleep cycle begins with NREM sleep, starting with
N1, then transitioning to N2, then to N3, and then to a second N2, then to REM. A complete sleep cycle ends with REM.
NREM sleep and REM sleep continue to cycle throughout the course of sleep.
